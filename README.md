# DjangoMApp

I have created wap app for Maths quiz in Django. 

Here's how it works: Instructions

The app will randomly display math questions including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Users can enter their answers in a box.

Finally, the app tells the user well done if they answered correctly and if they did not, it tells them the correct answer.
